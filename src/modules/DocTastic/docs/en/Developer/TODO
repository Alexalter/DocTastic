# TODO

1. Add ability for admin to set NavType per mod basis (mostly working)
  - not sure the {foreachelse} is really doing anything - maybe it can be removed.
2. Add NavType: Sensei for in-document navigation (mostly working)
  - path is hardcoded at the moment
3. Add User view
4. Add full-text search API
