# TODO

1. Add ability for admin to set NavType per mod basis (mostly working)
  - disable the module selector in edit mode and delete new entry and refresh the view on edit fail
  - create hidden '0' value when table is blank (@see extmenu?)
  - not sure the {foreachelse} is really doing anything - maybe it can be removed.
2. Add NavType: Sensei for in-document navigation (mostly working)
  - path is hardcoded at the moment
3. Add User view
4. Add full-text search API
5. get a project at the cozi because this doesn't work well for issue tracking.
