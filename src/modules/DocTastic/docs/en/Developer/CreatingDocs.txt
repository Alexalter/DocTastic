## Creating Documentation to work with DocTastic

DocTastic is a documentation reader module for the Zikula Application Framework.
It provides access to and interpretation of Markdown files within a Zikula Installation.

## Quick Start
 1. Create a /docs folder in your module root e.g. `MyModule/docs`
   * Place your license.txt (or whatever you named it) in the `/docs` directory
 2. Create language-specific sub-directories within the /docs dir e.g. `MyModule/docs/en`
and `MyModule/docs/de` and `MyModule/docs/nl`
 3. Create `/User` and `/Admin` sub-directories (optional `/Developer`)
 4. Place files in the appropriate directory as required to document your module.
   * You may add unlimited files and add additional directory structure as you please.
   * DocTastic will attempt to render nearly any type of text-based file. For a list
of prohibited filetypes, please see `modules/DocTastic/lib/DocTastic/NavType/Base.php`
and locate the `$disallowedExtensions` property.

## Markdown

DocTastic uses [PHP Markdown Extra][] to render nearly any text file into html.
*PHP Markdown Extra* is an extension of [PHP Markdown][] which, itself, is a PHP
implementation of John Gruber's [Markdown][]:
> Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers.
Markdown allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format,
then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML).

## How and Why

Markdown was created so that your documentation would be easy to create and easy
to read both on the web and as a standalone text file. DocTastic adds an ease of
navigation within your documentation directory structure and give you the tools
to focus that documentation at the appropriate audience (User/Admin/Developer).

In addition DocTastic takes advantage of Zikula's inherent language handling to
further focus to your documents for your intended audience.

Because your documentation will now be within you module's directory structure it
is inherently version-controllable (like your code). This is of course very useful
because as your code evolves so will your documentation. This approach allows you
to keep you documentation up-to-date and current with your code without making you
rewrite it each time. Simply write it as you go or update as needed.
