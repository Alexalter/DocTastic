## Inline help

The inline help system is a bit less flexible than the main documentation module.
In order to utilize this, you must follow a more structured path and file naming
scheme.

### Directory Structure

The `/Help` directory must reside within the `<MyModule>/docs/lang/` directory:

Directory Structure
~~~
<MyModule>/docs/
    license.txt
    en/
        User/
        Admin/
        Developer/
        Help/
            Admin/
                modifyconfig.txt
                edititem.txt
                main.txt
            Default/
                help.txt
    de/
        User/
        Admin/
        Developer/
        Help/
~~~

Within the /Help directory, you should create an `/Admin` directory and a `/Default`
directory (eventually this may be expanded to include a `/User` directory, but it
currently does not). There is only one file in the `/Default` directory and that
should be 'help.txt'. This file is used whenever a regular doc file cannot be
found.


Inside the `/Admin` directory, your files must be named in all lowercase and must
be the **exact same as the name of the Admin class method** they are documenting.
The file also **must have a `.txt` suffix**.
