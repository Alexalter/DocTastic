Module Overrides
----------------

This area allows the administrator to override the standard behavior for any
module. Behaviors that can be changed are the **navigation type**, whether the
**language filter** is enabled, and whether the module should be **exempted**
from the list.

The first two areas are explained on the _Default settings_ page.

**Exempting a module** means that it will not be listed in the DocTastic
documentation viewer. You may choose to use this for modules that have no
internal (DocTastic-compatible) documentation.

To create an override, simply click the _Create new override_ link. When
finished, click the green check-mark to complete and save the settings.

Once an override has been created, it can be edited or deleted by clicking the
'red pen' edit icon.
